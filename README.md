# Company-data
(University project)

This project represents a company's data about their workers.
Everything after compile will be written inside a .txt file

## To do:
- Have a random ID given to every worker
- Have a console interface where instead of showing everything at once about the company,
  I could write an ID and then show me their full name so I can confirm who I chose,
  and then type what to show about that worker (ex. 'salary', 'tasks', etc.)
